// sudo /sbin/route add default gw 192.168.7.1

// uncommented the 28th line i.e. ipforwarding for ipv4 in /etc/sysctl.conf file 

// did this -> echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | /etc/resolv.conf file and by pinging to google getting bytes normally.

Why this happens:

By default, BeagleBone uses connman (a connection manager), which can overwrite /etc/resolv.conf.
Even if you manually set the nameserver, it might be reset on reboot or network change


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
adding this command to a file and (make it executable) putting it at the end of ./bashrc file to get internet access right after booting the BBB.

sudo /sbin/route add default gw 192.168.7.1

This command tells the BeagleBone how to reach the internet (or any network not directly connected).

default: This is the default route â€” i.e., where to send all traffic that's not for the local network.
gw 192.168.7.1: "Gateway" is the device that forwards your traffic to other networks. Here, it's 192.168.7.1.

Result: Now the BeagleBone knows that any internet traffic should be forwarded to 192.168.7.1.

ðŸ§­ What is 192.168.7.1?
In your BeagleBone setup:
BeagleBone gets the IP 192.168.7.2
Host laptop (Windows PC, via USB RNDIS Ethernet) gets 192.168.7.1
So, 192.168.7.1 is your laptop's IP on the USB interface â€” acting like a mini router.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

for a script or .c file/ executable to run on reboot then, a crontab must to be created with the following commands

$ crontab -e 
@reboot sh /home/debian/13_2_gpio.sh 

$ crontab -l // to see the lines added 
This is crontab(crontable) a utility used for scheduling commands or scripts to run automatically at specified intervals.
// crontab -r // to remove all the jobs that are in the crontable
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a process and inside that process create 3 threads and send data from 1 thread and the other 2 thread should print that data.
how to send the data is up to me, char data, block data, stream of data etc the method should be best for the data transfer.
- This has been done and is done through global variable method and the other 2 types i.e. shared memory and message queue
